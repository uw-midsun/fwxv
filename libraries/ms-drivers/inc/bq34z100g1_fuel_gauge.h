Brief: Used to get register values from the fuel gauge using the Bq34z100g1Command commands
Param:
  storage - pointer to an initialized Bq34z100g1Storage, really just to store the i2c information
  command - determines the value returned by ret. P.11 of the data sheet outlines the value
            returned from each command. Note that some commands are for utility purposes and do
            not return a value, if one of these commands is used in a call to this function it
            will return STATUS_CODE_INVALID_ARGS.
  subcommand - the BQ34Z100G1_CONTROL command requires a subcommand. Some of these subcommands
               are used to set values, if one of these commands is used in a call to this function
               it will return STATUS_CODE_INVALID_ARGS.
  ret - array provided by user to hold value returned by fuel gauge. The least signigicant bit will
        be stored in the first byte and most significat bit will be stored in the second. In case
        of a command that only returns an 8 bit val, the upper byte will be set to 0x00.
Return: Returns STATUS_CODE_OK on successful command, STATUS_CODE_INVALID_ARGS when incorrect
        command used, and forwards error codes from any i2c driver failures
